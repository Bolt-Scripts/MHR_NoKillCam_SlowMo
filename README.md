# MHR NoKillCam Plus SlowMo Mod
 
I had an idea, so I did it, and it's pretty cool.

The main features of this mod are:
Disables the aerial view of the monster from different angles after killing them.
Disables fast travel cutscene cam and end of quest cam (like petting your buddies etc.)
Enters slow motion for a certain duration of time after the last blow on the monster.

Enjoy.

Requirements:
1) [REFramework](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/26)﻿

**Installation:**
1) Install REFramework;
2) Download the mod;
3) Extract the mod from the archive and place it in MonsterHunterRise folder.

Final path to the mod should be like this: MonsterHunterRise/autorun/SlowMoEnd.lua

**Customization:
**You can change the values through the REFramework UI but idk how to make those save so, the file SlowMoEnd.lua file has some values for customization. Open it with any text editor, adjust and change values in Customization Section according to your preference. 
The effect of each option is explained there.

Notes:
**-I didn't test it in multiplayer as I haven't played multiplayer yet since I wanna (slowly) finish the campaign first. So it either doesn't work at all, or looks glitchy. But probably harmless either way. I'd recommend only using slowmo in single player. It's way too tedious to sift through the game objects so if someone wants to tell me where I can find a bool for if its multiplayer I'll gladly edit it so that it automatically doesn't work in multiplayer.
-If using disableOtherCams, it can be slightly glitchy with fast travel camera transitions. There also might be some edge case that explodes everything somewhere or some game cutscene thing idk. So use at own risk.
-I didn't think it'd work for captures too but it does. Which was kinda not intended, but at this point I can't be asked to fix it, and it's not really a big deal anyway.

Thanks to the dev(s) over at REFramework for making the tool to allow this to happen at all. (Even if I am still salty there's no search function yet. And that I have to program in nasty ol' Lua)
